# Toll Data Reconciliation Project (SQL)

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world data reconciliation task similar to tolling and financial systems.
The goal is to compare transaction data from two partially integrated systems and identify discrepancies
that could impact data integrity, reporting accuracy, and financial operations.

## Systems Simulated
- System A: Transaction Processing System
- System B: Financial Reporting System

## Objectives
- Identify missing transactions between systems
- Detect mismatched toll amounts
- Flag duplicate transaction records
- Validate data completeness and integrity

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite-compatible syntax)
- GitHub for version control and documentation

## How to Run
1. Run `sql/01_create_tables.sql` to create tables
2. Run `sql/02_insert_sample_data.sql` to insert sample data
3. Run `sql/03_reconciliation_checks.sql` to perform reconciliation checks

These scripts are written in SQLite-compatible SQL.
